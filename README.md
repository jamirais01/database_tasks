**Database Coursework – SQL Queries, Schema & Seeding**

This project contains the full database solution for a set of SQL exercises completed as part of Embedded Systems course at LAB University of Applied Sciences.
The work includes creating a PostgreSQL database, designing tables, inserting sample data, and writing SQL queries to explore and analyse the relationships between courses, tasks, assignments, students, completions, and earned credits.

**What Was Done**

* Created a PostgreSQL database with tables for **Course**, **Task**, **Assignment**, **Student**, **Completion**, and **Credits**.
* Wrote a **complete set of SQL queries** to:

  * List assignments with related tasks and courses
  * Show completions with task and assignment details
  * List students with their courses, grades, and credits
  * Display tasks completed by students
  * Count assignments per course
  * Identify courses without assignments
  * Detect assignments completed late
  * Find students missing credits
  * Summarize course performance (students, grades, credits)
* Created a **seeding script** that populates the database with realistic sample data.

### **Project Files**

* `create_tables.sql` – Database structure (tables)
* `queries.sql` – All required SQL queries for the assignment
* `seeding_data.sql` – Sample dataset for testing
* `README.md` – Overview and instructions

This project serves as a complete example of SQL query writing, relational database design, and practical analysis tasks using PostgreSQL.
